## Session Handoff Notes

**For Next Session**:
1. Start with Phase 4, Task 4.1: Implement unit conversion
2. Create function to convert mm + DPI to SVG units: (mm * dpi) / 25.4
3. Task 4.2: Calculate perpendicular direction for line adjustments
4. Task 4.3: Implement single line adjustment (without propagation yet)

**Context for Phase 4**:
- Interactive line selection complete - users can mark lines as adjustable
- Line data has `isAdjustable` and `multiplier` properties set by user clicks
- Need to calculate new line lengths based on `state.materialThickness` and `state.dpi`
- Direction calculation uses shape `windingOrder` and perpendicular vectors
- Adjustments expand "away from" or contract "toward" shape centroid

**Data Structures Ready**:
- Global `state` object with `materialThickness` and `dpi`
- `state.shapes[]` array with closed shapes
- Each line has `startPoint`, `endPoint`, `angle`, `length`, `isAdjustable`, `multiplier`
- Shape has `windingOrder` ('cw' or 'ccw')
- Interactive overlays in `line.interactiveLine` for visual updates

**Key Algorithm Notes**:
- Unit conversion: `svgUnits = (mm * dpi) / 25.4`
- Perpendicular vector: rotate line direction vector by 90°
- Use winding order to choose correct perpendicular direction (toward or away from centroid)
- For now, only adjust the line itself - don't propagate to adjacent lines (Phase 5)
