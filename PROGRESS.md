## Session Handoff Notes

**For Next Session**:
1. Optional: Implement Phase 6 tab/slot classification (if needed for real-world SVGs)
2. Implement Phase 8 polish: input validation, edge case handling, UI improvements
3. Test with real laser-cut SVG files

**Current Implementation Status**:
- **Phases 1-5 + Phase 7 core: COMPLETE**
- All geometric adjustment logic working
- Change propagation maintains closed shapes
- SVG paths update with new geometry
- Visual feedback and interaction working

**What Works**:

- SVG updates in real-time
- Download button ready (basic functionality exists)

**Known Limitations**:
- Phase 6 (tab/slot classification) not implemented
  - Currently treats all non-adjustable lines as translatable
  - For laser-cut patterns, may need to mark slot edges as "fixed"
- No special handling for corner tabs/slots yet
- Limited input validation
- No error recovery for malformed SVGs

**Key Implementation Details**:
- All code refactored into ES6 modules in `app/js/`
- Adjustment engine in `app/js/adjustments.js`
- Phase 5 function `applyAdjustmentsPhase5()` is the main entry point
- Uses recursive propagation with Set-based loop prevention
- SVG paths updated via `path.plot(pathArray)` after adjustments
