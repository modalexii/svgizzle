- [ ] Task 4.2: Implement direction calculation
  - Calculate shape centroid
  - Determine perpendicular vector to line
  - Use winding order to choose correct perpendicular direction

## Session Handoff Notes

**For Next Session**:
1. Start with Phase 3, Task 3.1: Implement line click detection
2. Need to add click handlers to individual line segments
3. Challenge: Line segments are part of paths, not separate elements
4. Approach: May need to create invisible overlay paths for each line segment to enable clicking
5. Alternative: Use path hit testing with mouse coordinates

**Context for Phase 3**:
- Each line segment has SVG.js path reference in `line.svgPath`
- Line segment data is in `state.shapes[].lines[]`
- Need to map clicks to specific line segments within paths
- Color scheme defined: normal=#000000, 1x=#2196F3, 2x=#9C27B0

**Data Structures Ready**:
- Global `state` object populated
- `state.shapes` array contains closed shapes
- Each shape has `lines` array with geometric data
- Line segments have `isAdjustable` and `multiplier` properties ready to use
